# 🎓 AcademiaOS 🎓

Welcome to **AcademiaOS**, your one-stop solution for academic information retrieval and reasoning! We've built this on a robust large language model platform equipped with a bouquet of features dedicated to providing the best assistance for researchers possible.

## 🌟 Features 

* **Find Academic Papers**: Building on the SemanticScholar corpus and OpenAI embeddings, AcademiaOS finds and ranks relevant papers to your search queries. 
* **Upload PDFs**: If you have curated papers or other qualitative documents (such as interview transcripts) as PDFs, you can upload them for downstream tasks. Text-PDFs are handled in-browser while scanned PDFs are OCRd using Adobe PDF Extract API.
* **Mass Information Extraction**: Structurally extract information (such as a paper's sentiment towards your thesis or information such as the count of study participants) from papers at scale.
* **Automated Literature Review**: Navigate with a clean and intuitive interface.
